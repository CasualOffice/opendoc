// The English a script-side string is written down in, once (docs/124 §3.1).
//
// Markup declares its own English beside its `data-i18n` attribute, where it
// is readable in place. A script has nowhere to put it, so it goes here: one
// file a translator's tooling reads, one file `build-locale.mjs` merges into
// `locales/en.json`, and one place a reviewer can see every sentence the
// editor can say without reading 17,000 lines to find them.
//
// A `t("key")` whose key is absent from here fails the build. That is what
// stops a call site from inventing a key no translator will ever be shown.
//
// PLURALS are families, not strings: `.one`, `.other`, and whatever else a
// language needs. English declares the two it has; a Russian catalogue adds
// `.few` and `.many` without any call site changing, which is the entire
// reason plural selection lives in the seam (`i18n.mjs`).
